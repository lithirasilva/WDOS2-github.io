        <div class="paragraph"><!--Intro-->
            <p>The oldest marine turtle fossils were discovered around 150 million years ago.They used to travel
               in too mnay different groups to count throughout the oceans of the world.
               However, in only the past 100 years, turtle numbers have been in decline because to the desire for 
               their meat, eggs, skin and exquisite shells. due to ocean pollution, loss of feeding and nesting
               areas, and other issues, the last remaining populations of sea turtles are currently suffering tremendously.
               Breeding populations ijn existence have already lost a significant portion of their numbers, and an entire 
               species are vanishing. Sea turtles could soon become a rare species only found in aquariums and natural
               history museums if nothing is done about it right now.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The loggerhead and olive ridley sea turtles are listed as threatened in the United States under the 
               endangered species act, while the green leatherback, and hawkbill sea turtles are listed as endangered.
               According to the international Union for Conservation of Natural and Natural Resources (IUCN),hawksbill
               turtles are critically endangered and face an extremely high risk of going extinct in the wild in the
               near future, while olive ridley sea turtles are listed as endangered and face a very high risk of going
               extinct in the wild in the near future.

            <h2>Types of threats</h2>
            <img src="images/Eggcollection.jpg" class="egg" alt="egg"><!--image for first threat-->
                <div class="collection"><h3>Egg collection</h3><!--First Threat-->
                <p>significant issue is the egg gathering of marine turtles. Sea turtle embryos are prized as 
                    an uncommon delicacy in Sri Lanka. Many of the eggs deposited along the Southern 
                    Coast of the nation are gathered and distributed for human consumption.</p>
                <p>To safeguard the hatchlings, sea turtle hatcheries have begun purchasing the embryos 
                    from vendors. However, the neighborhood's turtle species will go extinct if egg collection 
                    keeps up at the present pace.</p></div>

                    <img src="images/hunting.png" class="hunt" alt="hunt"><!--image for second threat-->
                <div class="hunting"><h3>Illegal hunting</h3><!--Second Threat-->
                <p>Adult tortoises are still subject to illegal trapping. The flesh or attractive shells of the 
                    reptiles are reasons for their killing. Hunters frequently kill Hawksbills in particular 
                    because of their stunning projectiles.</p>
                <p>Hawksbills consume a lot of venomous marine creatures, which can make their flesh 
                    toxic, so consuming this turtle's meat could result in the capturer losing their life. The 
                    flesh has caused several deaths in Sri Lanka.</p></div>
                    
                    <img src="images/debris.jpg" class="debris" alt="debris"><!--image for third threat-->
                <div class="marine"><h3>Marine debris</h3><!--Third Threat-->
                <p>Numerous national and foreign groups labor to conserve sea turtles and safeguard 
                    their populations from these anthropogenic dangers. Sadly, Sri Lanka frequently 
                    lacks the funding necessary to maintain ongoing marine turtle protection programs at full strength.</p>
                <p>International organizations like the World Wildlife Fund and the UN are pushing 
                    fishers to transition to turtle-friendly circular hooks in an effort to decrease turtle 
                    injuries from nets and hooks. Poaching can also be avoided by assisting residents 
                    in finding better employment possibilities, such as ecotourism</p></div>

            <h2>Ways to prevent threats to turtles</h2><!--Prevention methods-->
            <br><br>
            <ul class="prev">
            <li>Care for wounded marine turtles includes feeding them, cleaning their shells, and preparing 
                sustenance for them.</li>
            <li>Help newly born young turtles get securely into the water so they can begin their voyage to 
                maturity by releasing them.</li>
            <li>Attend seashore clean-up events: Organize and participate in large-scale beach cleanups to ensure 
                that garbage isn't obstructing views or hurting aquatic life on the beaches.</li>
            <li>Move eggs to the hatchery: Find fresh turtle nests, hide the eggs in the project hatchery's 
                protected area, and correctly mark the nests.</li>
            <li>Upkeep of the hatchery: Keep the breeding places sanitary, secure, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Promote understanding showing visitors and residents around the nursery and emphasizing the 
                need to inform the public about the dangers confronting sea turtles in order to obtain their support</li>
            <li>To safeguard nesting turtles and ensure that they can deposit their eggs in tranquility, patrol 
                coastlines and scare off potential poachers and predators.</li>
            <li>Use conventional fishing poles to capture some fish to provide sustenance for the sanctuary's 
                wounded turtles.</li>
            <li>Tanks should be cleaned and refilled. In some instances, sea turtles remain in the sanctuary's 
                tanks until they are healthy enough to be released back into the water. The health of the tortoises 
                depends heavily on keeping these containers clean</li>
            </ul>
