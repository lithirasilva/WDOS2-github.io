            <h1><u>Importance of turtle hatcheries</u></h1><br><br><!--introduction-->
            <p>Sea turtles hold a major symbolic importance for many coastal communities around the world. Many indigenous cultures honor them or view them as elders. 
                The Sri Lankan ecotourism industry, a major and expanding sector of the nation's tourism industry, is another important source of income for seaside residents. 
                Marine turtles are more desirable alive than dead, according to study, because selling their parts (eggs, flesh, and shells) can earn three times as much money as selling them whole.
                <br><br>
                They are an influence and a source of awe. Watching them navigate through a reef, drag themselves up a shoreline to mate, 
                or watch hatchlings dive into the water is awe-inspiring and unforgettable.</p>

                <br><br>
                Due to the fact that five of the seven species of sea turtles currently in existence call Sri Lanka home, 
                it is one of the finest countries to work with sea turtles. Sea turtles have existed for millions of years; 
                they were already moving through our seas at that time.
                <br>
                Sea turtles have been around for a very long time, 
                but they are still highly vulnerable to both natural and man-made dangers. Experts anticipate that all of the 
                various kinds of marine turtles may become extinct if effective protection programs are not created and kept. 
                Each international turtle volunteer is urgently required because conservation programs demand extensive resources 
                that a country like Sri Lanka cannot afford.

                <div class="he2"><strong>Why are sea turtles in Sri Lanka endangered?</strong></div>
                <br><br>
                Humans pose the greatest danger to marine turtles in Sri Lanka despite the fact that they have natural predators. 
                The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of Sri Lanka makes it illegal to murder, injure, or otherwise cause damage
                to a turtle. 
                <br>
                Additionally, removing or destroying turtle eggs is a government crime, as is owning or selling turtles. 
                Unfortunately, harmful actions continue to affect these marine creatures.

        <div class="pg1pic3par">
            <p>Sadly, because of significant human meddling and natural predators, sea turtle numbers worldwide are rapidly declining. 
                Human poachers, who abuse the eggs to sell to turtle shelters or to locals as a source of food or medication, are one of Sri Lanka's greatest issues. 
                The 40 purported sanctuaries that border Sri Lanka's west shore are truly a significant issue. 
                Unfortunately, these initiatives are only in place to profit from visitors, and cruel acts continue to be committed on a daily basis.</p>

                research, and education. To achieve its vision of "Sustainable level for sea turtle populations in 
                Sri Lanka," the TCP's objective is to conduct research, studies, education & awareness programs, 
                community-based protection & management programs.</P>
                <br>
            <p>Numerous community-based ecosystem approach conservation programs have been launched by TCP, including in-situ marine turtle nest

                schools, environmental education, school lectures, alternative income generation training, nature
