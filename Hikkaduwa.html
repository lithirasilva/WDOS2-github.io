        The Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Center, which aims to preserve some of the world's endangered turtle 
        species, is located a few kilometers north of the major Hikkaduwa village. The southern shore of the 
        island is home to a number of turtle hatcheries, including this one. It began as a community initiative to 
        help safeguard the southern coast's wildlife, but it has since developed into a full-fledged hatchery and 
        rescue facility with devoted teams that toil around the clock to research, look after, and safeguard various turtle species.

    <div class="para1">
        They are trying to teach both locals and visitors and restore the population. When the young turtles are 
        ready, they are ultimately released back into the water after being carefully watched over turtle eggs.
        Veterinarians care for the wounded tortoises at the hatchery. Some may be wounded or be lacking a tail. 
        Before being released back into the water, adult turtles are being treated at the nursery.

        A wonderful instructional experience, visiting the facility lets you get close to the turtles without 
        disrupting their environment. To prevent animals from getting to the eggs, a netting has been used to 
        protect them. The young turtles are kept in an aquarium after hatching until they are ready to be released 
        into the water. For an extra charge, you can pay to have turtles returned to the water. 
        You can significantly aid in the recovery of these threatened species by visiting the facility.
